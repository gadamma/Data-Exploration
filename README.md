# Research Question: Do higher temperatures causally affect sales?

Based on our model and results, I can conclude that, between the ranges of 41 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit, there is evidence to support that higher temperatures negatively affect weekly sales. I came to this conclusion through our polynomial model that produces different results based on the temperature we are testing for. The model also had a fixed effect based on the store number, meaning we are observing the variation of data within the stores themselves and not against each other. This helps control for location-based variables that could have otherwise biased our results. I also controlled for year in order to remove variables related to time that could have biased our results.

In the document, I have detailed my full analysis and reasoning.
